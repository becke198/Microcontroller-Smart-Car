# Microcontroller-Smart-Car
Designed and programmed an autonomous car using a microcontroller, servo motor, and wheel assembly.  Implemented a Breadth-First Search (BFS) wavefront pathfinding algorithm to compute the shortest path. â€¢ Optimized algorithm for real-time navigation and successfully validated performance across multiple maze configurations.
